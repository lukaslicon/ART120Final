# CMPM120 Final Game - FutureBound
Final game created for CMPM120, UCSC Spring 2023

**Theme:** "Nearby in space, but distant in time."
Our team tackled this idea quite literally, with the player being sent forward into the future to view the exaggerated consequences of the housing crisis and possible deforestation.

**Selectable Requirements:**
1. Advanced visual assets, with a video based ending
2. Procedural audio, ambient environment audio and sfx from ToneJS
3. Procedural graphics, Phaser Graphics class and shader effects
